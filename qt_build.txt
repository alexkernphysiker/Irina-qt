Build requires libqt and libqt-devel packages installed on your system.
Data output plugin uses gnuplot sowtware, so it should also be installed.
The configuration and build can be done automatically.
Run script "1-autoconf" for creating directory for binaries
and file qt_build_path.pri required for all qmake projects here.
Edit this file if needed (View it to see if it's needed!!!!)
After creating this file please run "2-get_dep" script for downloading
required repository(ies). Then you may run "3-buildme" for building 
and the binaries should appear in ../bin directory
