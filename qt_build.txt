Building all qt projects in this repository requires file qt_build_path.pri. 
It should be created in upper directory.
Here is an example of it's possible content:
#BEGIN qt_build_path.pri
#build location
DESTDIR = <your build path>
win32: DLLDESTDIR = $$DESTDIR
DEPENDPATH += $$DESTDIR
#configuration
win32: DEFINES += WINBUILD
unix:{
  QMAKE_LFLAGS += -Wl,--rpath=$$DESTDIR
  QMAKE_LFLAGS_RPATH=
}
#END qt_build_path.pri
It can be use also for building other repositories from by Github account.
For this could be possible, call "git clone" command for all repositories at the same directory and put the file qt_build_path.pri in it.
